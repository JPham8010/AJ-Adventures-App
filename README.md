## Description

## Known Bugs
1. Colors are not working correctly. CardView background does not update color when new color is chosen from ColorPicker in EditRecipeView.swift

## TODOs/Backlog
1. Fix icons for "ingredients" and "steps" in DetailView.swift to make more sense. (Potentially do a circle (.filled) to indicate boolean status)
